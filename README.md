# Building Energy Modelling

## Project description 
The primary objective of this project is to streamline the existing building energy modelling techniques that are used within the Measurement and Verification (M&V) principle. Energy signatures and outdoor air temperatures are regressed to create 3 Parameter Heating (3PH) models. 
The algorithm used is able to:
- Identify and create seperate energy models for each building in a dataset.
- Automatically select the best balance point temperature for each.
- Can introduce splitting points to assess different time periods seperately.
